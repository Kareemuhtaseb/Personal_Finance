# Frontend White Screen Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED!**

The white screen issue has been fixed by:

1. **Installing missing dependencies:**
   - `npm install axios`
   - `npm install pinia`

2. **Fixing axios import issues:**
   - Replaced axios with native fetch API to avoid import conflicts
   - Updated API service to use fetch instead of axios

3. **Fixing router initialization:**
   - Moved auth store initialization to App.vue
   - Fixed navigation guards to use localStorage directly

## 🚀 **Current Status**

- ✅ Frontend is running on: `http://localhost:5174`
- ✅ Backend should be running on: `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ API service working with fetch
- ✅ Authentication system connected
- ✅ Dashboard data integration ready

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

1. **Open your browser and go to:** `http://localhost:5174`

2. **You should see:**
   - Login page (since you're not authenticated)
   - Beautiful glassmorphism design
   - No white screen!

3. **Test the connection:**
   - Try to register a new account
   - If backend is running, it should work
   - If backend is not running, you'll see connection errors (but no white screen)

## 🔧 **If You Still See White Screen**

### Check Browser Console:
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Share the error messages if you see any

### Check Network Tab:
1. In Developer Tools, go to **Network** tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for any failed requests (red entries)
4. Check if the main HTML file loads successfully

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### 1. **Node.js Version Warning**
```
You are using Node.js 20.17.0. Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+
```
**Solution:** This is just a warning, the app should still work. If you want to fix it, upgrade Node.js.

#### 2. **Port Already in Use**
```
Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...
```
**Solution:** The app automatically uses port 5174, which is fine.

#### 3. **Backend Not Running**
If you see connection errors in the console, start the backend:
```bash
cd my-dashboard/backend
npm run dev
```

#### 4. **CORS Errors**
If you see CORS errors, make sure:
- Backend is running on port 3001
- Frontend is running on port 5174
- Backend CORS is configured for the frontend URL

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **Without Backend Running:**
- ✅ Login page loads (no white screen)
- ✅ Beautiful UI displays
- ❌ API calls will fail (expected)
- ❌ Can't actually login (expected)

### **With Backend Running:**
- ✅ Login page loads
- ✅ Can register new account
- ✅ Can login
- ✅ Dashboard loads with real data
- ✅ All features work

## 🚀 **Quick Start Commands**

### Start Backend:
```bash
cd my-dashboard/backend
npm run dev
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd my-dashboard
npm run dev
```

### Or use the batch file:
```bash
cd my-dashboard
start-testing.bat
```

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still seeing a white screen:

1. **Check the browser console for errors**
2. **Make sure both servers are running**
3. **Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)**
4. **Try opening in an incognito/private window**
5. **Check if any browser extensions are blocking the page**

The most common cause of white screens is JavaScript errors, which should now be visible in the browser console.
